Your task is to carefully analyze this page from the PDF and convert all textual content into a human-readable markdown format. The final objective is to maintain the original meaning and organization of the PDF so that a reader can understand it as if they were viewing the original document.

- Preserve headings, bullet points, numbered lists, or any other structural cues that convey organization. 
- If tables are detected, please retain the same row-and-column relationships by preserving the tabular structure in markdown. Use | for columns and - for header rows, aligning columns so that the data remains clear without distortion.
- If you detect mathematical formulas or equations, keep them in valid LaTeX:
  - Inline: $ ... $
  - Display: $$ ... $$
- Include all textual content without any omission or changes. Do not add summarizations, paraphrasing, or explanations outside the text.
- Avoid generating code fences or backticks (``` or ```markdown). Simply produce the final extracted markdown text.
