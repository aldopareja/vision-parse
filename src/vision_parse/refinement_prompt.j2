Review and refine the previously extracted markdown while comparing against the original image. Your response should have two parts:

1. First, provide your analysis in <thinking> tags:
   - Assess the accuracy of the previous extraction
   - Identify any formatting or structural issues
   - List specific elements that need improvement
   - Outline your refinement approach

2. Then, provide the refined markdown in <markdown> tags, following these guidelines:

Refinement Focus Areas:
- Content completeness and accuracy
- Heading level hierarchy
- List structure and nesting
- Table formatting and alignment
- Equation formatting ($ vs $$)
- Image description brevity
- Footnote and reference pairs
- Multi-column content order

Important:
- Don't add new content
- Don't duplicate existing content
- Keep original meaning intact
- Maintain document structure
- Focus on readability
- Keep image descriptions brief
