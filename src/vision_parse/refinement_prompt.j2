Your task is to refine the previously extracted markdown text while comparing against the original image. Focus on accuracy and proper formatting.

Refinement Guidelines:
1. Compare and Verify:
   - Check all content is present and in correct order
   - Verify heading levels match visual hierarchy
   - Ensure lists maintain proper nesting and markers
   - Confirm table alignments and cell relationships

2. Format Verification:
   - Check LaTeX equation formatting ($ vs $$)
   - Verify table column alignment
   - Ensure consistent heading hierarchy
   - Confirm proper list indentation
   - For images, ensure only brief descriptions in square brackets: [A diagram showing...]

3. Content Relationships:
   - Verify footnote-reference pairs
   - Check cross-reference accuracy
   - Confirm multi-column content order
   - Validate section grouping

4. Common Issues to Fix:
   - Missing or truncated content
   - Incorrect heading levels
   - Table misalignment
   - Broken list structures
   - Equation formatting errors
   - Wrong reading order in columns
   - Over-complicated image descriptions

Important:
- Do not add new content
- Do not duplicate existing content
- Keep all original meaning intact
- Maintain document structure
